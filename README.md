# DiscordBot_using_Python
I have created A simple Discord bot in Python using Discord's library


In this lines of codes we can see that i used all 'intents' as intents = discord.Intents.all() not as intents= discord.Intents.default() because of recent discord updates Intents were stated necessary to pass down.
The 'BOT_TOKEN' is the token generated by the discord developer Portal and is very important and is hidden because of security purposes, all you need to do is replace your generated token in 'BOT_TOKEN'.

I will be updating this bot after some time.
